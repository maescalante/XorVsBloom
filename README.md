# XorFilterEvaluation

Both bloom filters and Xor filters provide fast set membership queries while occupying little memory, but they each come with their own trade offs and caveats. The objective of this project is to write an efficient implementation for both to do a fair and through comparison of space usage, false positive ratio (fpr), construction time and query time.  


## How to run
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the command `make`
3. To run all the experiments run `make run`
